VSCODE DARK
-----------
This is a theme package for IDA 7.3+. It was adapted from the VSCode theme in [IDASkins](https://github.com/zyantific/IDASkins).  

Go there for screenshots etc. This was just a quick port with a few small changes to my liking.  
To install just clone this repo into idabin/themes (IDA 7.3)  

For IDA 7.4+ (built in theme engine) clone the theme into `~/.idabin/themes` (mac/linux) or `%APPDATA%\Hex-Rays\IDA Pro\themes`
